# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my repository of machine learning projects! This repository contains a collection of projects that I've worked on to apply and enhance my skills in machine learning, data analysis, and artificial intelligence.

## Projects Overview

### [Project 1: Tumor Classification with Logistic Regression](https://github.com/DAGV001/Modelos-de-aprendizaje/blob/main/Early_Detection_of_Malignant_Tumors_A_Logistic_Regression_Approach%20(1).ipynb)
- **Objective:** Develop a logistic regression model to classify tumors as benign or malignant.
- **Technologies:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
- **Key Achievements:** Achieved an accuracy of 98.2%, a precision of 100% and a recall of 95.2% applied feature selection and PCA to improve model performance.
