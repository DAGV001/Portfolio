# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my repository of machine learning projects! This repository contains a collection of projects that I've worked on to apply and enhance my skills in machine learning, data analysis, and artificial intelligence.

## Projects Overview

### [Project 1: Tumor Classification with Logistic Regression](https://github.com/DAGV001/Modelos-de-aprendizaje/blob/main/Early_Detection_of_Malignant_Tumors_A_Logistic_Regression_Approach%20(1).ipynb)
- **Objective:** Develop a logistic regression model to classify tumors as benign or malignant.
- **Technologies:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
- **Key Achievements:** Achieved an accuracy of 98.2%, a precision of 100% and a recall of 95.2% applied feature selection and PCA to improve model performance.
### [Project 2: Employee Attrition with Logistic Regression](https://github.com/DAGV001/Portfolio/blob/main/Employee_Attrition.ipynb)
- **Objective:** Analyze employee attrition data to identify key factors contributing to employee turnover and build a predictive model.
- **Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn.
- **Key Achievements:** Built a logistic regression model to predict employee attrition with high accuracy. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights into employee turnover. Applied SMOTE to handle class imbalance and used GridSearchCV to optimize model parameters.
### [Project 3: California Housing Price Prediction](https://github.com/DAGV001/Portfolio/blob/main/California_Housing_P.ipynb)
- **Objective:** Predict housing prices in California using various regression techniques.
- **Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.
- **Key Achievements:**  Developed multiple regression models to predict housing prices. Conducted data preprocessing, including handling missing values and feature scaling. Achieved high predictive accuracy with the regression models.
